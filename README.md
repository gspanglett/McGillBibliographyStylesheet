## NOTE TO ALL USERS:  

This is a first effort, and is offered as-is.  

I will continue to post improvements, but I work full-time, attend law school part-time, and I have a family and two school-aged children.

The next round of updates will most likely be posted around the end of December 2019/January 2020.

Issues will be reviewed, and I will do my best to roll in any enhancement requests/issue fixes in the next release.

Gareth Spanglett.


# McGill Legal Style Bibliography Stylesheet Addon for MS Word

Adds "McGill Legal" as a citation style in the References section of MS Word.  It also creates new citation source types for:  

 - cases, 
 - legislation, 
 - legal journals,
 - social media posts,
 - patents
 - trademarks
 - copyright.  
 
Other source types updated to be McGill-compliant are books (plus collections of essays), websites, and electronic, online resources. The popup form in MS Word to enter sources has also been modified to match McGill general form descriptions.

It will auto-generate bibliographies (ordered based on McGill Guide) and Tables of Authorities (by category). It also stores citation sources in a master file, for easy re-use in other documents.

And, it will automatically track and update supra note references.

There are two limitations: it is for footnote citations only; I will make a separate style for in-text citations used in memoranda and facta sometime soon. And ibid has to be done manually.

Finally, the next version will include support for government publications and international documents.  I would also like to release a French version.
